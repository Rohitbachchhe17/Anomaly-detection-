# What is an anomaly?
An anomaly is basically something that’s unusual, doesn’t fit the usual pattern, or stands out because it’s different in a specific category or situation. To explain it simply, let’s look at some clear examples:

Think about a collection of smartphones, mostly from Samsung, and then there’s an iPhone. The iPhone is an anomaly because it’s a different brand.
Imagine you have a bunch of pens, but one of them is a fancy fountain pen instead of a regular ballpoint pen. That fountain pen is an anomaly because it’s not like the others.

# What is anomaly detection?
Anomaly detection is a technique used to identify data points that are significantly different or “outliers” when compared to the majority of the data in a dataset.

Anomaly detection is about finding data points that are different from what is considered normal or expected, and it relies on historical data or established knowledge to determine what falls within the usual range. It plays a crucial role in ensuring the quality and security of data in various domains.

#Example of anomaly detection in server logs:
1) Normal behavior:
Website traffic follows a regular pattern.
Requests per minute show a predictable trend, with slight increases during peak hours.

2) Anomaly:
Suddenly, there is an unusual, significant surge in traffic.
This spike in requests per minute is an anomaly in the server logs.

# Anomaly detection use cases
Here are some diverse applications of anomaly detection using machine learning:

- Event detection in sensor networks
- Manufacturing quality control
- Healthcare monitoring
- Social media monitoring
- Fraud detection
- Network intrusion detection
- Healthcare monitoring
- Insurance claim analysis
- Cybersecurity threat detection
- Identity theft
- Traffic monitoring
- Network intrusion detection
- Data breaches
- Intrusion detection
- Video surveillance

# The three settings for anomaly detection, as described by Dr. Thomas Dietterich and his team at Oregon State University in 2018:

1) Supervised Anomaly Detection: In this setting, the anomaly detection model is trained on a labeled dataset, which means that each data point is explicitly marked as either normal or anomalous. The model learns the characteristics of normal data and uses this knowledge to detect anomalies in new, unseen data. Supervised anomaly detection is effective when you have a reliable labeled dataset for training, and it is suitable for scenarios where anomalies are relatively easy to define and identify.
ML Algorithm for structured data:
- Bayesian networks
- k-nearest neighbors (KNN)
- Decision trees

2) Clean Anomaly Detection: Clean anomaly detection refers to situations where the data is mostly clean and free from noise or errors, making it easier to detect anomalies. In this setting, the focus is on identifying significant deviations from the established normal patterns. Clean anomaly detection is commonly used in applications where the data is well-structured and follows predictable patterns, such as fraud detection in financial transactions or quality control in manufacturing.

3) Unsupervised Anomaly Detection: Unsupervised anomaly detection occurs when there are no labeled anomalies in the training data, and the model needs to identify anomalies without prior knowledge of what constitutes an anomaly. The model’s task is to find data points that deviate significantly from the majority of the data, making it suitable for cases where anomalies are rare or poorly understood.
ML algorithm for unstructured data:
- K-means
- One-class support vector machine

# Here are some common approaches to anomaly detection:

a) Statistical methods:
- Z-Score/Standard Score: This method measures how many standard deviations a data point is away from the mean. Points that fall far from the mean are considered anomalies.
- Percentiles: Identifying anomalies based on percentiles or quantiles, where values below or above a certain threshold are considered outliers.

b) Machine learning algorithms:
- Isolation Forest: An ensemble learning method that builds a tree structure to isolate anomalies efficiently.
- One-Class SVM: A support vector machine (SVM) model trained to classify data points as normal or outliers.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Assigns an anomaly score based on the distance to the K-nearest neighbors, with distant points being potential anomalies.
- Autoencoders: Neural networks designed to learn a compressed representation of data, where reconstruction error can be used to identify anomalies.

c) Clustering methods:
- DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise): Clusters data points based on their density, with points that do not belong to any cluster considered outliers.
- K-Means Clustering: Data points that do not belong to well-defined clusters may be considered anomalies.

d) Time-series analysis:
- Moving Averages: Identifying anomalies based on deviations from the moving average or exponential moving average.
- Seasonal Decomposition: Decomposing a time series into its trend, seasonal, and residual components, with anomalies often detected in the residual component.

e) Proximity-based approaches:
- Mahalanobis Distance: Measures the distance of data points from the center of the data distribution, considering correlations between features.
- Local Outlier Factor (LOF): Computes the local density deviation of a data point compared to its neighbors, identifying regions of different densities.
